This project aims to be a very flexible git repo server, and should require no
specific infrastructure. All authentication and authorization is delegated to
Apache Shiro, which itself is very flexible.

Before building this project, you currently have to build Shiro from source
yourself. See http://incubator.apache.org/shiro/download.html

The Main class is an example of how to set up the server. As you can see there,
the starting point is to call ServerFactory and ask it to create a server for
you. It needs a Shiro SecurityManager, which you should have created with one or
more Shiro Realms of your choice. If you include a PublicKeyAuthenticatingRealm
in the SecurityManager, your users will be able to use ssh public keys for
authentication.

The Main class is built by the shjgit-standalone module into a file which
includes all dependency jars, so you can launch it with:

  java -jar target/shjgit-standalone-*-executable.jar



TODO and GOTCHAS:

Currently, there is no authorization. All authenticated users are able to do
everything.

If a user pushes to a git repo path which does not already have a git repo in
it, a git repo is automatically created there. That is likely not the desired
behavior for all installations.

The Main class example is mildly useful on its own. A proper server config and
deployment mechanism is needed.
